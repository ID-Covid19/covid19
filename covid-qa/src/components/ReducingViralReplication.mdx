# How to reduce viral replication?
Clinical and bench trials to investigate less common viral inhibitors against COVID-19 such as naproxen, clarithromycin, and minocyclinethat that may exert effects on viral replication.

## 1. Proteasome Inhibitors

> ..Inhibition of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System Affects Influenza A Virus Infection at a Postfusion Step. We have demonstrated that influenza A virus (IAV) RNA synthesis depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. IAV replication was reduced both by <mark>proteasome inhibitors</mark> and in E36ts20 cells, which contain the thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. While virus entry was not affected in E36ts20 cells, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 retained viral particles in the cytoplasm. Addition-removal experiments of MG132 in combination with bafilomycin A1, a well-established inhibitor of IAV entry and fusion, showed that MG132 affected IAV infection at a postfusion step. This was confirmed by the lack of inhibition of IAV entry by proteasome inhibitors in a virus-like particle fusion assay..

## 2. Classic Hsp90
> ..Inhibition of Heat-Shock Protein 90 Reduces Ebola Virus Replication. Ebola virus (EBOV), a negative-sense RNA virus in the family Filoviridae, is known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and other primates. Infection with EBOV causes a high mortality rate and currently there is no FDA-licensed vaccine or therapeutic treatment available. Recently, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, was shown to be an important host factor for the replication of several negative-strand viruses. We tested the effect of several different Hsp90 inhibitors including geldanamycin, radicicol, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; a geldanamycin analog) on the replication of Zaire EBOV. Our results showed that inhibition of Hsp90 significantly reduced the replication of EBOV. <mark>Classic Hsp90</mark> inhibitors reduced viral replication with an effective concentration at 50% (EC(50)) in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range, while drugs from a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors showed markedly more potent inhibition. These compounds blocked EBOV replication with an EC(50) in the low nanomolar range and showed significant potency in blocking replication in primary human monocytes. These results validated that Hsp90 is an important host factor for the replication of filoviruses and suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may be therapeutically effective in treating EBOV infection..

## 3 Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA

> ..Antiviral Activity and RNA Polymerase Degradation Following Hsp90 Inhibition in a Range of Negative Strand Viruses. We have analyzed the effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors in blocking the replication of negative-strand RNA viruses. In cells infected with the prototype negative strand virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), inhibiting Hsp90 activity reduced viral replication in cells infected at both high and low multiplicities of infection. This inhibition was observed using two Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol. <mark>Silencing of Hsp90 expression using siRNA</mark> also reduced viral replication. Hsp90 inhibition changed the half-life of newly synthesized L protein (the large subunit of the VSV polymerase) from >1 hour to less than 15 minutes without affecting the stability of other VSV proteins. Both the inhibition of viral replication and the destabilization of the viral L protein were seen when either geldanamycin or radicicol was added to cells infected with paramyxoviruses SV5, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, or SV41, or to cells infected with the La Crosse bunyavirus. Based these results we propose that Hsp90 is a host factor that is important for the replication of many negative strand viruses..
